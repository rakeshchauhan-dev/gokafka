Docker Installation:

Ensure that Docker is installed on your local machine. You can download Docker from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/get-started.

Pull the confluentinc/cp-zookeeper Docker image by running the following command:

Open the Go program example file in an editor of your choice.

Look for any configuration variables or properties that need to be modified, such as Kafka broker addresses, topic names, or other relevant settings.

Update the necessary configuration values to match your Kafka setup.

Monitor the program's output or logs to ensure that it is running without any errors.

Verify that the program is producing or consuming messages from the Kafka topic(s) as intended.

If necessary, make any additional configuration changes or troubleshooting adjustments based on the program's behavior.
Document the Process:

Update the README file with detailed instructions on how to install Kafka using Docker and run the Go program.
Include any additional setup requirements, configuration details, or troubleshooting steps that might be helpful for others trying to run the program.
