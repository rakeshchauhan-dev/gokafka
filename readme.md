Docker Installation:

Ensure that Docker is installed on your local machine. You can download Docker from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/get-started.
Follow the installation instructions provided by Docker based on your operating system.
Docker Pull:

Open a terminal or command prompt window.
Pull the confluentinc/cp-zookeeper Docker image by running the following command:
bash
Copy code
docker pull confluentinc/cp-zookeeper
Docker Run:

Start a Docker container using the pulled image by executing the following command:
css
Copy code
docker run -d --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 confluentinc/cp-zookeeper
This command runs the container in the background (-d flag) and maps the ZooKeeper port (2181) from the container to the host machine.
Install Go:

Ensure that Go is installed on your local machine. You can download Go from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/.
Follow the installation instructions provided by the Go project based on your operating system.
Clone the Repository:

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Go program example to your local machine using the git clone command. For example:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Replace username with the actual username and repository with the name of the repository.
Install Kafka Go Library:

Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository containing the Go program.
Install the Kafka Go library by running the following command:
go
Copy code
go get github.com/segmentio/kafka-go
Configure the Go Program:

Open the Go program example file in an editor of your choice.
Look for any configuration variables or properties that need to be modified, such as Kafka broker addresses, topic names, or other relevant settings.
Update the necessary configuration values to match your Kafka setup.
Build and Run the Go Program:

In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Go program is located.
Build and run the Go program by executing the following command:
go
Copy code
go run main.go
This command compiles and runs the Go program.
Verify Program Execution:

Monitor the program's output or logs to ensure that it is running without any errors.
Verify that the program is producing or consuming messages from the Kafka topic(s) as intended.
If necessary, make any additional configuration changes or troubleshooting adjustments based on the program's behavior.
Document the Process:

Update the README file with detailed instructions on how to install Kafka using Docker and run the Go program.
Include any additional setup requirements, configuration details, or troubleshooting steps that might be helpful for others trying to run the program.
